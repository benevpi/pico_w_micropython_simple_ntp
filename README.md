# pico_w_micropython_simple_ntp
A very simple way of setting the time of Pico W via NTP using MicroPython. This just gives you the ability to set the RTC on Pico W from NTP

not my code. I've ripped it off examples and wrapped it as a package. Copy simple_ntp.py to your device and take a look at the example code to see how it works.
